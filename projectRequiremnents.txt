Points--->

1) Need to add Functionality of adding an event.
- We can store the events inside an object.
- Event start and end date should be stored inside that object.
  ex - start_date: 24-3-2024, end_date: 25-3-2024
- User should be able to add single day and multiple day's event.
- For showing the event on calendor we can add some sort of symbol to identify.
- The days which contains event should be coloured (For now it's green).
